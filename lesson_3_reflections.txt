1) When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to use a remote repository when you are working on a group project. Also, it would be good to use incase your local machine breaks.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Manually pulling changes allows me to determine when code is brought down. This means that code won't change unexpectedly without me knowing about it.

3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

A clone creates a clone - a copy of a repo. A branch takes a working directory and adds a new line of commits which runs in tandem with the master branch in the same repo. A fork is like a clone only it is on the github server: cloning one repo on github to another repo on github. You use a fork when you like a repo on github and want to tinker with it and/or make it your own - this would be equivalent to cloning someone else's repo to your computer then pushing that repo up to github as your own remote repo.
