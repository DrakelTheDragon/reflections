1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It adds a hidden Git folder into the directory. It needs to be done to start using git in the directory.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

 Staging area is the preparation area for files to be committed. Only files in this area are going to be included in the commit executed next time. It helps to divide changes in the working directory into several commits, each of which consists of a group of changes that represent a logical change to the relevant files.

3) How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can add in specific files that you want to commit instead of doing all files at once to make them more logical.

4) What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

If you want to try an experimental build with changes that might break your program you can create a branch for it so it will not affect your original data. You can keep doing changes to that branch and also go back to your orignal master branch.
